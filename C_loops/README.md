# C Loops

This repository is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding loops in the C programming language. Loops are essential constructs that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly, making our programs more efficient and flexible.

## Introduction

In C programming, loops are used to perform a set of actions repeatedly based on certain conditions. They are a fundamental part of any programming language and are crucial for tasks like iterating through arrays, processing data, and creating responsive programs.

## Types of Loops

C supports three types of loops:

1. **`for` loop:** This loop is used when we know in advance how many times we want to repeat a block of code.

2. **`while` loop:** Use this loop when we want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

3. **`do-while` loop:** This loop is similar to the `while` loop but guarantees that the code block will run at least once before checking the condition.

## Loop Control Statements

C provides loop control statements to manage the flow of loops effectively:

- `break`: Terminates the loop and transfers control to the statement immediately after the loop.

- `continue`: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

- `goto`: Allows us to jump to a labeled statement, although its use is discouraged in most cases.

## Examples

To get a better understanding of how loops work in C, explore the `C_loops/` directory. You'll find simple code examples for each type of loop, along with explanations.
