## Getting Started

If you're new to C programming, here are some steps/tips to get started:

1. **Set up your development environment:**
   - Install a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on your computer.
   - Choose a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing C code.

2. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/C_Programming_Practice.git
   ```

3. **Explore the code examples:**
   - Browse the examples in my various directories for simple C code examples that cover various concepts.

4. **Start coding:**
   - You are welcome to create your own C programs in a `practice/` directory and experiment with the code.

## Learning Resources

## Coding Challenges

Practice is key to mastering any programming language. I challenge myself with coding exercises and projects. These challenges are a great way to apply what I've learned and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Projects

In addition to coding challenges, I am working on personal projects to further enhance my C programming skills. Feel free to add your own projects and collaborate with others.
